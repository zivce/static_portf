This is a simple shooter game made in vanilla **ES6**, with help of **RxJS**. Stuff used to make these figures is pure CSS. Backend used for this game is **JSON server**, and there are two files used for saving scores and selecting the difficulty. One can play this game just by moving mouse right and left to move the player, and pressing space will fire the bullets at enemies. Enemies travel at different speeds, and some are harder to kill than others. If you fire enough bullets at enemy, it will disappear, and you will get score boost.
