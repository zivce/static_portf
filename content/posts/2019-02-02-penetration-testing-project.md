## Intro

In few next posts I will describe a project, that we did as part of software engineering class. It is about _**ethical hacking**_, and it represents a platform on which pentesters connect with website owners. The team consisted of two Laravel developers and me.

  * Vue
  * Vuex
  * Jest
* **Back-End**
  * Laravel

## App Idea

We thought of building an app where pentesters can find job, and website owners or web developers can check their site for vulnerabilities. Clients can test their site on their own and attach that file when looking for pentester or to check the site on their own. Pentesters can find jobs easily and bid on them, the best of them will win clients' attention and get picked.
